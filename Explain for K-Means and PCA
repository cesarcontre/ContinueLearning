In the next code is show a way of compress a image with high density of pixels into N clusters, then using PCA for getting evena more efficiency product.

For only K-Means, a function was created using the library cv2 for the parameters and model, for the fitting, the image was turn into a 2 dimensional array, after applying the K clusters, 
the final image is return. The image display is with cv2.imshow().

The same function is added the PCA (Principal Component Analysis), it was applied the PCA from sklearn.decomposition to the pixels of the image, then the clusters.
